# PS> Start-Blog

Welcome to cmdlet dot org. I am your host, cptcmdlet. I work in IT by accident, and its been awhile. I have nothing against Linux, I just ended up in the realm of Windows. I don't hate it here. One reason I don't hate it is PowerShell. I learn best when I'm trying to find the solution to a particular problem, and that is how I've come to know a little PowerShell. That also brings me to the point.

# PS> Get-Point

I do not have a degree in computer science. I am not a developer. I've learned 100 things that I've learned 100 ways of doing better later. But the things I've built have always worked, always done the job, and always acted as a learning bridge to the better way - including better understanding why better ways are better. Yeah - I'm the guy who has to do it wrong so I understand why the right way is right. That's what this site is. Me sharing my brute force, bullheaded, learning experiences. So if you see something and know of a better way, let me know. I'm aware of my ignorance.
