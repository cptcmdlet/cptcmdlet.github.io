Hi. I'm CptCmdlet. I do a lot of PowerShell at work. I may share some professional scripts here, but it's likely to mostly be the fun oddball stuff I do to explore concepts I later use for less fun work scripts. I am not an expert. I got into IT and PowerShell entirely by accident. I liked computers for gaming, art, and data hoarding. I learned networking, scripting, and general internet mischief along the way. I didn't realize it'd be my career. 

In fact, before I dropped out to get a job that could actually pay bills after making some dumb decisions, I was studying English Literature after quitting Digital Art to dodge a class called "The Mathematics of Design" that sounded like the opposite of why I chose an art degree.
